You won’t need to install any software, since everything will run in the cloud.\nThe idea behind this workshop is simple: you don’t need fancy setups or extraordinary tools to start doing fun coding things!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChecklist\n\n\n\n\nBring your own laptop\n\nHave a Google account ready\n\nUse ChatGPT (free version)\n\nIf you don’t already have an account, you can sign up using Proton Mail, a free, privacy-friendly email service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail: barbara.romero_ferron(at)leuphana.de"
