    "text": "Welcome to our workshop Coding Provenance for Lab & Friends!\nThink of this as a crash course with a twist: we’ll dive into coding, data cleaning, analysis, and visualization in a fun, hands-on way. By the end of the session, you’ll have shaken off the fear of coding and feel empowered to tackle these tasks on your own with confidence!\n\n\n\nDate: September 24, 2025\n\nTime: 11:00–13:00 — lunch break — 14:00–18:00\n\nLocation: Leuphana University Room: C.40.108\n\n\n\n\n\nKnowledge Design\nLearning the Language\nFrom Text to Data\nData Preprocessing\nExploratory Analysis & Visualisation\n\n\n\n\nThis workshop requires only very basic tech skills to the extend of having using a computer before. You won’t need to install any software, since everything will run in the cloud.\nThe idea behind this workshop is simple: you don’t need fancy setups or extraordinary tools to start doing fun coding things!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChecklist\n\n\n\n\nBring your own laptop\n\nHave a Google account ready\n\nUse ChatGPT (free version)\n\nIf you don’t already have an account, you can sign up using Proton Mail, a free, privacy-friendly email service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail: barbara.romero_ferron(at)leuphana.de"
